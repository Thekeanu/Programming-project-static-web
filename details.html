                    Angry Man follows the story of Daniel Rivers, a once-successful businessman whose life spirals out of control due to anger and frustration. After losing his job, his family, and his sense of purpose, Daniel retreats into isolation, haunted by his inability to control his temper. As his rage continues to consume him, he begins to lash out at the people around him, from his ex-wife and estranged son to strangers he meets on the street.
                    One day, Daniel encounters a mysterious therapist named Dr. Elaine Matthews, who offers him a chance to confront the root of his anger. Reluctantly, Daniel agrees to attend therapy, but the process is far from easy. As he delves into his past, he uncovers painful memories of childhood trauma, failed relationships, and the deep-seated insecurities that fuel his rage.
                    The film explores themes of redemption, forgiveness, and the destructive power of unresolved emotions. As Daniel works to rebuild his life, he discovers that true peace comes not from avoiding anger, but from understanding and controlling it. In the end, Daniel learns that the most difficult battle is not against the world, but against the anger within himself.
                    Angry Man is a powerful emotional journey that highlights the importance of self-reflection and personal growth in overcoming life's darkest moments.
